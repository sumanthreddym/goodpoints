## What is Goodpoints

Goodpoints is a social good loyalty platform built using Square Loyalty API that allows Square's sellers and merchants to build meaningful and deep relationships with their customers by allowing them to use the loyalty points that they earned from purchases at their stores to donate to social causes & charities that they care about.

## Inspiration

### Problem I'm trying to solve

These days, the significance of building real and lasting customer loyalty goes without question. Many businesses and brands, on the other hand, are struggling to stay relevant as customers move away from transactional interactions with their favorite brands in search of new ways to connect with their own drive to do more, to do more for everyone. Businesses are being encouraged to take things to the next level by engaging and connecting with their members in increasingly meaningful and personal ways. Square is used by businesses of all size. "How can we strengthen relationships with our consumers and communities at the same time?" is a question that should be on the minds of most merchants and businesses that use Square. Well, Goodpoints platform could be the solution.

### I'm a business who uses Square. Will my customers use their points to donate to charity rather than buying a product for themselves?

While traditional redemption components such as gift cards, merchandise and cash continue to play an important role, adopting newer, more compelling redemption strategies and options which include social good components in loyalty programs will provide businesses with the competitive advantage they need to stay ahead of the curve and respond to the rapidly changing consumer mindset. Social Good Loyalty is a real revolution that is being driven by a generation of people who truly want to take pride in the products they buy, the companies with whom they align, and to feel empowered to support their local communities. 

Research shows that companies are increasingly broadening their loyalty programs to incorporate their brand mission and take position on issues that are important not just to them, but also to their consumers.A large retailer just created a new social good loyalty program in which customers decide how much money the company donates to each of thousands of community charities. And the list of charity changes every quarter to keep it thematically relevant and responsive to current events. The figures from this program are incredible. The store built stronger relationships with tens of millions of program participants and donated millions of dollars to thousands of charity through the program.

Brands can utilize social good loyalty platforms such as Goodpoints to build stronger bonds with customers by supporting issues that are personal, relevant, and local. I believe there is a tremendous opportunity for companies to connect with and invest in their people, their communities, and their purpose. 


### Any Studies that support this will work?

According to Motista statistics, emotional connections translate into a bigger percentage of consumer spending, with loyal consumers paying twice as much and having a 300 percent higher lifetime value. We are currently witnessing a boom in community spirit, with consumers and companies more eager than ever to support social, environmental, and community activities. Brands that allow their customers to give to a cause they care about should expect to see higher levels of emotional engagement and loyalty because they are tapping into something they already care about – their favorite charity. 


## How does it help Square's sellers and businesses?

Consumers are increasingly expecting that companies utilize their position to make a difference, and rewarding customers to use their points to make charity donations can help you build more meaningful relationships and demonstrate that you're a purpose-driven company.

There are two advantages to including donations in your reward program:

- Boost your brand's image: It acts as a constant reminder to your consumers that your company is committed to social impact, highlighting the fact that giving is one of your top objectives.

- Encourage more customers to sign up for your rewards program: It also encourages more consumers to sign up for your loyalty program, resulting in more purpose-driven purchases, more real connections, and higher customer lifetime value.

## How it works?

- Square's merchants and businesses should enroll in Square's Loyalty program to use this product. 
- After a Square merchant enrolls in Square's Loyalty program, they can enroll their business on Goodpoints to allow their customers to use their loyalty points for making donations to non-profits, causes and charities that they care about. Optionally, merchants can add their own choices of non-profits. Merchants also need to choose how many dollars each point is equivalent to.
- Goodpoints creates a unique URL and QR code for the business or merchants. Merchants can give this URL to their customers, which can be used by the customers to access Merchant specific Goodpoints site.
- Customers use the link to visit Goodpoints site, where they can login with their mobile number connected to their loyalty account.
- Customers use their points to donate to charities of their choice. 
- Customer receives a confirmation about the donation. Customers also can check their previous donation transactions made on Goodpoints.

## How I built it

I used Square's Loyalty API and Customer API to build Goodpoints web application. Goodpoints uses Square's Loyalty API to fetch a customer's point balance and allow customers to donate their points to causes and charities that both customers and businesses care about.

## Challenges I ran into

While thinking about this idea, I initially thought that businesses wouldn't be willing to use this kind of a loyalty platform. Then, I started my research on how brands could build customer engagement by connecting their loyalty programs and donations. It believe this sort of social loyalty platform is essential for sustainable growth of all modern businesses.

## What I learnt and Accomplishments I'm proud of

This was the first time I used Square APIs. It was quite an inspiration to learn how Square plays a vital role in enabling every business to have access to financial tools. I learnt more about the need for businesses to make social impact to stay relevant. 

I love the app that I built and hope that it enables Square's businesses not only to strengthen relationships with their customers but also allow Square's customers to make a lasting impact to the ecosystem that they operate in.

## What's next for Goodpoints
