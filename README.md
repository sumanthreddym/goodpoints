## What is Goodpoints

Goodpoints is a social good loyalty platform built using Square Loyalty API that allows Square's sellers and merchants to build meaningful and deep relationships with their customers by allowing them to use the loyalty points that they earned from purchases at their stores to donate to social causes & charities that they care about.

## Inspiration

These days, the significance of building real and lasting customer loyalty goes without question.   Many businesses and brands, on the other hand, are struggling to stay relevant as customers move away from transactional interactions with their favorite brands in search of new ways to connect with their own drive to do more, to do more for everyone.

Businesses are being encouraged to take things to the next level by engaging and connecting with their members in increasingly meaningful and personal ways. "How can we strengthen relationships with our consumers and communities at the same time?" becomes the question. While traditional redemption components such as gift cards, merchandise, cash, and travel rewards continue to play an important role, adopting newer, more compelling redemption strategies and options will provide businesses with the competitive advantage they need to stay ahead of the curve and respond to the rapidly changing consumer mindset.

At the forefront of these seismic shifts in the industry is the emergence of social good components in loyalty programs. Social good rewards programs take customer engagement beyond simply donating loyalty points to charity, as an option on the back pages of the redemption catalogue. Companies are increasingly broadening their loyalty programs to incorporate their brand mission and take position on issues that are important not just to them, but also to their consumers.

Brands may utilize social good loyalty programs to build stronger bonds with customers by supporting issues that are personal, relevant, and local. One large retailer, for example, just created a new social good loyalty program in which customers decide how much money the company donates to each of thousands of community charities. And the list of charity changes every quarter to keep it thematically relevant and responsive to current events. The figures from this program are incredible. The store built stronger relationships with tens of millions of program participants and donated millions of dollars to thousands of charity through the program.

Social Good Loyalty is not just a fad or a trend, but a real revolution that is being driven by a generation of people who truly want to take pride in the products they buy, the companies with whom they align, and to feel empowered to support their local communities. mart brand marketers may take advantage of this shift in consumer behavior by leveraging technological advancements and data analytics to provide more tailored and engaging interactions with their consumers.

I believe there is a tremendous opportunity for companies to connect with and invest in their people, their communities, and their purpose. 

Businesses are now building social justice activism opportunities directly into their programs by letting customers donate a portion of their points to support the causes they admire. hese programs can be good for both customers, brands, and society itself. It’s no surprise that emotional affinities are deeply intertwined with purchase decisions and loyalty inclinations. It turns out the charity-specific tactics are associated with specific, highly desirable performance metrics.

Brands that allow their customers to give to a cause they care about should expect to see higher levels of emotional engagement and loyalty because they are tapping into something they already care about – their favorite charity. According to Motista statistics, emotional connections translate into a bigger percentage of consumer spending, with loyal consumers paying twice as much and having a 300 percent higher lifetime value. We are currently witnessing a boom in community spirit, with consumers and companies more eager than ever to support social, environmental, and community activities.

## How does it help Square's sellers and businesses?

Consumers are increasingly expecting that companies utilize their position to make a difference, and rewarding customers with charity donations may help you build more meaningful relationships and demonstrate that you're a purpose-driven company.
There are two advantages to including donations in your reward program:

#### 1. Boost your brand's image
It acts as a constant reminder to your consumers that your company is committed to social impact, highlighting the fact that giving is one of your top objectives.

#### 2. Encourage more customers to sign up for your rewards program.
It also encourages more consumers to sign up for your loyalty program, resulting in more purpose-driven purchases, more real connections, and higher customer lifetime value.
